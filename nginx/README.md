# ServerAdmin Installers - NGINX

The NGINX Auto-Installer compiles the latest Mainline version of NGINX from source and builds it against the latest versions of OpenSSL, PCRE, and ZLIB. There are currently zero configuration options, though the `installer.sh` file located in `./installers/nginx` is documented and can be modified to suite individual needs. A `systemd` service script is also included.

A total of three modules are currently compiled in with the current build script:

- [https://github.com/simpl/ngx_devel_kit](https://github.com/simpl/ngx_devel_kit)
- [https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts](https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts)
- [https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli)

Additionally, `./installers/nginx/examples` contains an assortment of configuration examples, including:

- Load Balancing (`examples/lb`)
- PHP-FPM (`examples/php`)
- Proxy (`examples/proxy`)
- SSL (`examples/ssl`)

SSL Configuration is kept current as per [https://cipherli.st/](https://cipherli.st/). Depending on your needs, you may need to edit the ciphers and extend what's supported since the list is strict. A `dhparam.pem` file is generated by the Auto-Installer and defaults to `4096` bits -- it can be found in `/etc/nginx/ssl`.

To start, stop, or restart NGINX:

- `systemctl start nginx`
- `systemctl stop nginx`
- `systemctl restart nginx`
